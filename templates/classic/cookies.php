<h1 class="page-title">Klipsam&rsquo;s use of cookies and similar technologies</h1>
		<div class="clear"></div>
		<div class="ui divider">
		</div>
<p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Klipsam uses cookies and other similar technologies, such as pixels  or local storage, to help provide you with a better, faster, and safer  experience. Here are some of the ways that the Klipsam  services&mdash;including our various websites, APIs, email notifications,  applications, buttons, widgets, and ads&mdash;use these technologies: to log  you into Klipsam, save your preferences, personalize the content you  see, protect against spam and abuse, and show you more relevant ads.</p>
<p>Below we explain how Klipsam, our partners, and other third parties  use these technologies, your privacy settings and the other options you  have.</p>
	<br />
	<br />
<h3>What are cookies, pixels, and local storage?</h3>
		<div class="clear"></div>
		<div class="ui divider">
		</div>
<p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Cookies are small files that websites place on your computer as you  browse the web. Like many websites, Klipsam uses cookies to discover how  people are using our services and to make them work better.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">A pixel is a small amount of code on a web page or in an email  notification. As many services do, we use pixels to learn whether you&rsquo;ve  interacted with certain web or email content. This helps us measure and  improve our services and personalize your experience on Klipsam.</p>
<p>Local storage is an industry-standard technology that allows a  website or application to store information locally on your computer or  mobile device. We use local storage to customize what we show you based  on your past interactions with Klipsam.</p>
	<br />
	<br />
<h3>Why does Klipsam use these technologies?</h3>
		<div class="clear"></div>
		<div class="ui divider">
		</div>
<p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Klipsam uses these technologies to deliver, measure, and improve our  services in various ways. These uses generally fall into one of the  following categories:</p>
<ul>
<li> <strong>Authentication and security:</strong> 
<ul>
<li>To log you into Klipsam</li>
<li>To protect your security</li>
<li>To help us detect and fight spam, abuse, and other activities that violate the&nbsp;<a href="/rules">Klipsam Rules</a> </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">For example, these technologies help  authenticate your access to Klipsam and prevent unauthorized parties  from accessing your account. They also let us show you appropriate  content through our services.</p>
<ul>
<li> <strong>Preferences:</strong> 
<ul>
<li>To remember information about your browser and your preferences</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">For example, cookies help us remember  your preferred language or country that you are in. We can then provide  you with Klipsam content in your preferred language without having to  ask you each time you visit Klipsam. We can also customize content based  on your country, such as showing you what topics are trending near you,  or to withhold certain content based on applicable local laws.</p>
<ul>
<li> <strong>Analytics and research:</strong> 
<ul>
<li>To help us improve and understand how people use our services, including Klipsam buttons and widgets, and Klipsam Ads</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">For example, cookies help us test  different versions of our services to see which particular features or  content users prefer. We might also optimize and improve your experience  on Klipsam by using cookies to see how you interact with our services,  such as when and how often you use them and what links you click on. We  may use Google Analytics to assist us with this.</p>
<ul>
<li> <strong>Personalized content:</strong> 
<ul>
<li>To customize our services with more relevant content, like tailored trends, stories, ads, and suggestions for people to follow</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">For example, local storage tells us which  parts of your Klipsam timeline you have viewed already so that we can  show you the appropriate new content. Cookies can help us make smarter  and more relevant suggestions about who you might enjoy following based  on your recent visits to websites that have integrated Klipsam buttons  or widgets. We can suggest people who are frequently followed by other Klipsam users that visit the same websites.</p>
<ul>
<li> <strong>Advertising:</strong> 
<ul>
<li>To help us deliver ads, measure their performance, and make them  more relevant to you based on criteria like your activity on Klipsam and  visits to our ad partners' websites</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">For example, we use cookies and pixels to  tailor ads and measure their performance. Using these technologies, we  can show you ads and evaluate their effectiveness based on your visits  to our ad partners' websites. This helps advertisers provide  high-quality ads and content that might be more interesting to you.</p>
	<br />
	<br />
<h3>Where are these technologies used?</h3>
		<div class="clear"></div>
		<div class="ui divider">
		</div>
<p>Klipsam uses these technologies on our own websites and services and  on other websites that have integrated our services. This includes our  advertising and platform partners&rsquo; websites and sites that use Klipsam  buttons or widgets, like our klip or follow buttons. Third parties may  also use these technologies when you interact with their content from  within our services, like when you click a link or stream video on Klipsam from a third-party website.</p>
	<br />
	<br />
<h3>What are my privacy options?</h3>
		<div class="clear"></div>
		<div class="ui divider">
		</div>
<p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">We are committed to offering you meaningful privacy choices. &nbsp;You  have a number of options to control or limit how Klipsam, our partners,  and other third parties use cookies:</p>
<ul>
<li>For tailoring suggestions on Klipsam: If you do not want Klipsam to  tailor suggestions for you based on your recent visits to websites that  have integrated Klipsam buttons or widgets, you can turn off this  feature using your&nbsp;<a href="/settings">Klipsam account settings</a>. This removes from your browser the unique cookie that enables the feature.</li>
<li>For tailoring ads on Klipsam: If you do not want Klipsam to tailor  ads based on our ad partners&rsquo; information, including cookies, you can  turn off this feature using your&nbsp;<a href="/settings">Klipsam account settings</a>.  Then Klipsam will not match your account to cookie or other information  shared by our ad partners for tailoring ads.</li>
<li>For using cookies: You can modify your settings in most web browsers  to accept or deny all cookies, or to request your permission each time a  site attempts to set a cookie. Although cookies are not required for  some parts of our services, Klipsam may not work properly if you disable  cookies entirely. For example, you cannot log into Klipsam.com if  you've disabled all cookie use.</li>
