<h2>Klipsam Privacy Policy</h2>
		<div class="clear"></div>
		<div class="ui divider">
		</div>
<p>Klipsam instantly connects people everywhere to what&rsquo;s most  meaningful to them. Any registered user can send a klip, which is a  message that is public by default and can  include other content like photos, videos, and links to other websites.</p>
<p class="tip"><span class="tip">Tip</span> What you say on Klipsam may be viewed all around the world instantly.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 10px;">This Privacy Policy describes how and when Klipsam collects, uses and  shares your information when you use our Services. Klipsam receives  your information through our various websites, APIs, email  notifications, applications, buttons, widgets, and ads (the "<strong>Services</strong>" or "Klipsam")  and from our partners and other third parties. For example, you send us  information when you use Klipsam from our website, post or receive klips, or access Klipsam from an application such as Klipsam  for Mac, Klipsam for Android or klipDeck. When using any of our  Services you consent to the collection, transfer, manipulation, storage,  disclosure and other uses of your information as described in this  Privacy Policy. Irrespective of which country you reside in or supply  information from, you authorize Klipsam to use your information in any country where Klipsam operates.</p>
<p>If you have any questions or comments about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@Klipsam.com">privacy@Klipsam.com</a> or <a href="/contact">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="section1">Information Collection and Use</h3>
		<div class="clear"></div>
		<div class="ui divider">
		</div>
<p class="tip"><span class="tip">Tip</span> We collect and use your information below to provide our Services and to measure and improve them over time.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><strong>Information Collected Upon Registration:</strong> When you create or  reconfigure a Klipsam account, you provide some personal information,  such as your name, username, password, and email address. Some of this  information, for example, your name and/or username, is listed publicly on  our Services, including on your profile page and in search results. Some  Services, such as search, public user profiles and viewing lists, do  not require registration.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><strong>Additional Information:</strong> You may provide us with profile  information to make public, such as a short biography, your location,  your website, or a picture. You may provide information to customize  your account. We may use your contact information to send you information  about our Services or to market to you. You may use your <a href="/settings">account settings</a> to unsubscribe from notifications from Klipsam.  You may also  unsubscribe by following the instructions contained within the  notification or the instructions on our website.  We may use your  contact information to help others find your Klipsam account, including  through third-party services and client applications. Your <a href="/settings">privacy settings</a> control whether others can find you by your email address or cell phone  number. You may choose to upload your address book so that we can help  you find Klipsam users you know.  We may later suggest people to follow  on Klipsam based on your imported address book contacts, which you can delete from Klipsam at any time.  If you email us, we may keep your message,  email address and contact information to respond to your request.  If  you connect your Klipsam account to your account on another service in  order to cross-post between Klipsam and that service, the other service  may send us your registration or profile information on that service and  other information that you authorize.  This information enables  cross-posting, helps us improve the Services, and is deleted from Klipsam within a few weeks of your disconnecting from Klipsam your  account on the other service. Providing the additional information described in this section is entirely optional.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><strong>Klips, Following, Lists and other Public Information:</strong> Our Services are primarily designed to help you share information with  the world. Most of the information you provide us is information you are  asking us to make public. This includes not only the messages you klip  and the metadata provided with klips, such as when you kliped, but  also the lists you create, the people you follow, the klips you mark as  favorites or Reklip, and many other bits of information that result  from your use of the Services. Our default is almost always to make the  information you provide public for as long as you do not delete it from Klipsam, but we generally give you <a href="/settings">settings</a> to make the information more private if you want. Your public  information is broadly and instantly disseminated. For instance, your  public user profile information and public klips may be searchable by  search engines and are immediately delivered via our APIs to a wide range of users and services, which archives klips for historical  purposes. When you share information or content like photos, videos, and  links via the Services, you should think carefully about what you are  making public.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><strong>Location Information:</strong> You may choose to publish your location  in your klips and in your Klipsam profile.  You may also tell us your  location when you set your trend location on Klipsam.com or enable your  computer or mobile device to send us location information. You can set  your klip location preferences in your <a href="/settings">account settings</a>. We may use and store information about your location to provide features of our Services, such as kliping with your location, and to  improve and customize the Services, for example, with more relevant content like local trends, stories, ads, and suggestions for people to  follow.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><strong>Links:</strong> Klipsam may keep track of how you interact with links  across our Services, including our email notifications, third-party  services, and client applications, by redirecting clicks or through  other means. We do this to help improve our Services, to provide more  relevant advertising, and to be able to share aggregate click statistics  such as how many times a particular link was clicked on.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><strong>Cookies:</strong> Like many websites, we use cookies and similar  technologies to collect additional website usage data and to improve our  Services, but we do not require cookies for many parts of our Services  such as searching and looking at public user profiles or lists. A cookie  is a small data file that is transferred to your computer's hard disk. Klipsam may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to better  understand how you interact with our Services, to monitor aggregate  usage by our users and web traffic routing on our Services, and to  customize and improve our Services. Most Internet browsers automatically  accept cookies. You can instruct your browser, by changing its  settings, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a  cookie from the websites you visit. However, some Services may not  function properly if you disable cookies. Learn more about how we use  cookies and similar technologies <a href="/cookies">here</a>.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><strong id="widget-jump">Log Data:</strong> Our servers automatically record information ("<strong>Log Data</strong>")  created by your use of the Services. Log Data may include information  such as your IP address, browser type, operating system, the referring  web page, pages visited, location, your mobile carrier, device and  application IDs, search terms, and cookie information.  We receive Log  Data when you interact with our Services, for example, when you visit  our websites, sign into our Services, interact with our email  notifications, use your Klipsam account to authenticate to a third-party  website or application, or visit a third-party website that includes a Klipsam button or widget. Klipsam uses Log Data to provide our Services  and to measure, customize, and improve them.  If not already done  earlier, for example, as provided below for Widget Data, we will either  delete Log Data or remove any common account identifiers, such as your  username, full IP address, or email address, after 18 months.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 10px;"><strong>Widget Data:</strong> We may tailor content for you based on your  visits to third-party websites that integrate Klipsam buttons or  widgets.  When these websites first load our buttons or widgets for  display, we receive Log Data, including the web page you visited and a  cookie that identifies your browser ("<strong>Widget Data</strong>").   After a maximum of 10 days, we start the process of deleting or  aggregating Widget Data, which is usually instantaneous but in some  cases may take up to a week.  While we have the Widget Data, we may use  it to tailor content for you, such as suggestions for people to follow  on Klipsam.  Tailored content is stored with only your browser cookie ID  and is separated from other Widget Data such as page-visit information.   This feature is optional and not yet available to all users.  If you  want, you can suspend it or turn it off, which removes from your browser  the unique cookie that enables the feature.  For klips, Log Data, and other information that we receive from  interactions with Klipsam buttons or widgets, please see the other  sections of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Third-Parties:</strong> Klipsam uses a variety of third-party services  to help provide our Services, such as hosting our various blogs and  wikis, and to help us understand the use of our Services, such as Google  Analytics. These third-party service providers may collect information  sent by your browser as part of a web page request, such as cookies or  your IP address. Third-party ad partners may share information with us,  like a browser cookie ID or cryptographic hash of a common account  identifier (such as an email address), to help us measure ad quality and  tailor ads. For example, this allows us to display ads about things you  may have already shown interest in. If you prefer, you can turn off  tailored ads in your <a href="/settings">privacy settings</a> so that your account is not matched to information shared by ad  partners for tailoring ads.</p>
